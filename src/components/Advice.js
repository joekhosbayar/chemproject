            <p1 className = 'advice'>As you begin your journey in Chem 1410, we would like to offer you a couple pieces of advice in order to ensure a smooth and stress free experience in this course. As a group, we have taken this class and only want to make it easier for the next groups of students after us. Now when office hours are offered by TAs or by the professor themselves, take  advantage of this opportunity to enhance your knowledge of the chapter you’re currently learning, or maybe a chapter you have already discussed. Your TAs and your professor are there to help you as much as they can in order for you to understand the material and gain a basic understanding of chemistry. Even if you’re confident in the topics being discussed in class, there’s no reason you can’t revisit old information to further increase your knowledge in preparation for exams. Another piece of advice is to complete Tophat assignments early and revisit them as you’re discussing the chapter in class or reviewing for the exams. The chapter homeworks are there for you to have a physical copy of the information discussed in class, and to have ready-to-use notes whenever the need might arise. Getting the chapters, LBLAs, and BITs done early also save a lot of stress and cramming as the deadline approaches. Procrastination will never turn out successful in the long run for this course. Remember, as you begin to dive into the world of  Chem 1410, the goal is to stay organized, stress free, and a confident student at the University of Virginia. Good luck!!
